\subsection{Assuming roll mode}

The model in figure (1) in the assignement text is based on roll mode. We see that because $\beta$ and $r$ are not a part of the model. To find $\alpha_\phi_1$ and $\alpha_\phi_2$, we use the results from equation (\ref{roll_mode}):
\begin{equation*}
    a_{\phi_1} = 2.87 \quad \text{and} \quad a_{\phi_2} = -0.65
\end{equation*}
