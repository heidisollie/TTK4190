\subsection{Integrator on the roll loop}

From the slides of the book \cite{beard}, we know that adding an integrator on the inner loop adds delay and instability to the system. We prefer not to have these effects on inner loops because they can cause ripple effects on the outer loops. 

Since we have an integrator on the outer course loop, it is not necessary to have one on the inner loop because the integrator on the outer loop will correct for the steady state values.

Therefore we choose $k_{i_\phi} = 0$ for the rest of the assignment.
