\section*{Problem 1.8}


The main drawback of using unit quaternion over Euler angles is the potential singularities one gets at $\pm 90 \deg$.
The main drawback of using unit quaternion is that there are four parameters used in a three dimensional space which means we cannot guarantee a unique solution. Therefore we can only define a unique solution locally, not globally.
